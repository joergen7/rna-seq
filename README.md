# rna-seq

This workflow recreates an RNA-Seq study by
[Trapnell et al. 2014](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v7/n3/full/nprot.2012.016.html).

In this study, Tophat and Bowtie are used to align a pair of synthetic RNA read
samples (case and control) in FastQ format to the *Drosophila melanogaster*
reference genome (from
[iGenome](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html)).
